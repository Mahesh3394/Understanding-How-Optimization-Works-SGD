# Understanding-How-Optimization-Works-SGD
Optimization is very important concept in machine learning or deep learning. We are using multple optimization technique . One of such algorithm is SGC that Stochastic Gradient Descent. There are inbuilt libraries in python for same but in order to understand concept we are creating a code from scrtatch.
