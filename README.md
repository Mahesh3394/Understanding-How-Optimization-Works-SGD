# Understanding-How-Optimization-Works-SGD
SGD, or Stochastic Gradient Descent, is a widely used optimization algorithm for training machine learning models. It is particularly useful for training large-scale models where traditional gradient descent methods may be computationally expensive.

At a high level, SGD works by updating the model's parameters in small steps based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. In traditional gradient descent methods, the gradient is calculated over the entire training set, which can be computationally expensive. In contrast, SGD calculates the gradient on a randomly selected subset, or "mini-batch", of the training data, which makes it more efficient and faster.

Here's a brief overview of how SGD works:

Initialize the model's parameters with some values.
Divide the training data into mini-batches.
For each mini-batch:
a. Calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the model parameters using the mini-batch data.
b. Update the model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient by a small amount (learning rate) to minimize the loss.
Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the model converges or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
By randomly selecting mini-batches, SGD is less likely to get stuck in local minima and can help the model converge faster. However, because the gradient is calculated on a smaller subset of the data, the resulting parameter update may be noisy, which can lead to some instability in the training process.

Overall, SGD is a powerful optimization algorithm that can help accelerate the training of large-scale machine learning models.
